# Overview

Primarily a test case for [JSLint](http://www.jslint.com/).

[JConsole live example](http://boyvanamstel.github.com/JConsole/)

## What does it do exactly?

The Javascript gets the content of a DOM element, clears it and reinserts it as if someone is typing it in.

JSLint is a code quality tool for Javascript. I've included the OSX executable, running it will check the scripts for program errors as well as other problems.
